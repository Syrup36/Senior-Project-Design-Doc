To create the game, I will be using the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine. It is an engine that I have years of experience in.

Unity has built in physics/collision and handles 3D graphics, audio, UI, and input. It uses the C# language (which I also have years of experience in).

The game will use the Unity's new, event-based input system.

I have made games/applications in Unity before. Just this year, I made a VR application for my Tech Integration III (Help Desk) final project using Unity.
