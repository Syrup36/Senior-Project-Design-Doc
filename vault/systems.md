## Gameplay

Core gameplay would be a top-down, 3D "platformer." Movement is currently analogous to that of Animal Crossing. The player would traverse the small world to find their friends.




## Difficulty

As this game is meant to be a medium for me to display my findings, I am aiming for the game to be completely approachable for novice/casual players. There are no current plans for other difficulties.

The game is meant to be a completely relaxing experience, though there may be optional challenges available.
