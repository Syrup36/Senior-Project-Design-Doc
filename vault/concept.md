### Question: How do interactions, both with the environments and with others, affect mental health?

## Plot / Setting / Characters
The plot follows a group of friends who have decided to go camping together.

>
 - ___, the player character
 - **, the one who decided to go on the trip in the first place.

 The friends are all workers that live boring lives in the city. ** decided they should all go camping to help their mental health (TODO: MAKE BETTER).

It is the start of the first (and final) day of the trip. The player wakes up late and is greeted by **. ** tells the player that the rest of the group has gone exploring to find places they like. The player is tasked with finding each of them.

The game takes place in a forrest-esque location. The aim is for it to look nice.

Each person is "hidden" away in a different location. Upon finding them, the person found will tell you why they like each location.
Location are:
>
- In a cave
- Near a waterfall
- Under a tree outside
- With other campers
- Alone (?), surrounded by books/work

Each person will have a "description" of them in a submenu, that will hint at their current location as well as their personality.
