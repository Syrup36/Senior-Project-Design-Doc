## Music
I plan to make the music for the game with [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/). In Music Theory, we use a program called [Noteflight](https://www.noteflight.com/) to compose songs, and I may end up using compositions I made in class that are on there.

> [Link to Sample Music Track.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JCUYQZtnYx9GCHkMTQVqwWPfJy4wlD-f/view?usp=sharing)
Note that this was rendered directly from Noteflight and thus is only an unmastered MIDI rendition.

There will be 4-ish total tracks:
- One for the title screen
- One for the intro cutscene (subject to change)
> It's possible to reuse one of these for the outro
- One for the main world
- One for any 'subworlds'

## Sound Effects
Sound effects will be recorded by myself. They are typically made by using sounds from object strewn throughougt my house, and then the raw audio is edited with something like [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). Sound effects will most likely be minimal. They may include:
- Dialogue "noises" (in lieu of voice acting)
- Movement sound effects (noises for walking, jumping, etc.)
