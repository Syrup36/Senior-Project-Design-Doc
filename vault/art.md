## Tools
All 3D models will be create in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), while all 2D assets will be created either in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), [GIMP 2](https://www.gimp.org/), or [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/). [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) may also be used (most likely for texture painting), though I don't have much experience in it.

## Style
The game will be in a **low-poly style**. I have the most experience creating and rigging low-poly models, so this choice should streamline asset creation. Using a more simple style will also allow assets to be much smaller in size, demand less rendering resources, and will thus make the game able to be run on a wide variety of devices. 

Colors will stick to a specific color palette:

## Post Processing
Post processing will be applied as needed. I don't know much about color grading, but I assume some of it will be necessary.
