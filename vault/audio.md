## Music
I plan to make the music for the game with [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/). In Music Theory, we use a program called [Noteflight](https://www.noteflight.com/) to compose songs, and I may end up using compositions I made in class that are on there.

> TODO: Add possible composition from Noteflight (must be rendered)

There will be 4-ish total tracks:
- One for the title screen
- One for the intro cutscene (subject to change)
> It's possible to reuse one of these for the outro Possible to
- One for the main world
- One for any subworlds

## Voice Acting
The game will have no voice acting.

## Sound Effects
Sound effects will be recorded by myself. They are typically made by using sounds from object strewn throughoug my house, and then the raw audio is edited with something like [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). Sound effects will most likely be minimal. They may include:
- Dialogue "noises" (in lieu of voice acting)
- Movement sound effects (noises for walking, jumping, etc.)
