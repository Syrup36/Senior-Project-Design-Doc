## Gameplay

Core gameplay would be a top-down, 3D "platformer." Movement is currently analogous to that of Animal Crossing. The player would traverse the small world to find their friends.


The flow of the game, from start to finish, is modeled below:
```mermaid
    flowchart TB;
        A>Intro Cutscene]-->B[Tutorial];
        B-->C{Player Explores};
        C-->D[Player finds a Friend];
        D-->E[Player talks to the Friend];
        E-->C;
        C-->|Once All Friends are Found|F>Final Cutscene];
        F-->G>End Credits];     
```

Exploring the world could consist of small, non-punishing platforming sections as well as a few small puzzles (potentially, I'm still thinking about this).

## Difficulty

As this game is meant to be a medium for me to display my findings, I am aiming for the game to be completely approachable for novice/casual players. There are no current plans for other difficulties.

The game is meant to be a completely relaxing experience, though there may be optional challenges available. There is no way to lose the game - there are no lives, there is no punishment for falling off obstacles, and there are no penalties for taking your time.
