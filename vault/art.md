All 3D models will be create in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), while all 2D assets will be created either in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), [GIMP 2](https://www.gimp.org/), or [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/). [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) may also be used (most likely for texture painting), though I don't have much experience in it.
